# PickingRobot_DE10-Nano-SoC
This set of codes needs to be matched with physical objects, and high-efficiency picking up of badminton can be achieved only in standard badminton courts. 
From the basic composition of the robot, the badminton pickup robot is divided into a sensing system and a motion control system. The sensing system uses lidar to assist camera positioning and recognition of badminton, of which lidar uses secondary development. The software and hardware of the motion control system are designed by themselves.
